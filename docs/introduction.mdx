## Why ?
We believe documents are at the core of communicationâ€”invoices, contracts, resumes, bills, etc. They are the primary method for exchanging information with others professionally. So, why do we continue to use decades-old technology to create them? We believe you deserve better. Document production needs to be modernized. Start today and create your next PDF the same way you build a web app. And yes, this includes automating data integration into your documents. Say hello to react-print.

## Getting Started

React Print is designed to be incrementally adopted, so you can add it to most codebases in a few minutes.
