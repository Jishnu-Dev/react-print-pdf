## Why ?

<Callout intent="note" title="React Print outputs an HTML string">
  React Print is meant to help developers design PDFs. It outputs an HTML string
  that can be used to generate a PDF using a renderer like the [FileForge
  API](/api-reference/api-reference/generate).
</Callout>

We believe documents are at the core of communicationâ€”invoices, contracts, resumes, brochures, etc. They are the primary method for exchanging information with others professionally. So, why do we continue to use decades-old technology to create them? We believe you deserve better. Document production needs to be modernized. Start today and create your next PDF the same way you build a web app. And yes, this includes automating data integration into your documents. Say hello to react-print.

## Getting Started

React Print is designed to be incrementally adopted, so you can add it to most codebases in a few minutes.

<Callout intent="launch" title="React Print">
  React Print is your go-to library for creating PDFs using React and
  TypeScript. It provides a set of components to help you build amazing
  documents without having to deal with the mess of creating complex layouts and
  maintaining archaic markup.
