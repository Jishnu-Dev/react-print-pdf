## 1. Create directory

Create a new folder called `react-print-starter` and initialize a new npm project

```sh
mkdir react-print-starter
cd react-print-starter
npm init -y
```

## 2. Install the dependencies

Get the react-print package locally

<CodeBlocks>

```sh title="npm"
npm install @onedoc/react-print
```

```sh title="yarn"
yarn add @onedoc/react-print
```

```sh title="pnpm"
pnpm add @onedoc/react-print
```

</CodeBlocks>

## 3. Create your first PDF Component

Create a new folder call `documents`, then create a new file inside call `index.jsx` and copy the following code:

```jsx document/index.tsx
import { PageTop, PageBottom, PageBreak } from "@onedoc/react-print";
import * as React from "react";

export const Document = ({ props }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <PageTop>
        <span>Hello #1</span>
      </PageTop>
      <div>Hello #2</div>
      <PageBottom>
        <div className="text-gray-400 text-sm">Hello #3</div>
      </PageBottom>
      <PageBreak />
      <span>Hello #4, but on a new page ! </span>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## 4. Compile your document to HTML

```js index.tsx
import { compile } from "@onedoc/react-print";
import { Document } from "./document";

const html = await compile(<Document />);

console.log(html);
```

## 5. Generate your document with FileForge

It's now time to generate your PDF from your component. We recommend using [FileForge](/integrations/onedoc) as react-print has beem build especially to work witht his software. However, feel free to use any integrations that suits you the best.
