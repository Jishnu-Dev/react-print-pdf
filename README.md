# Introduction

A collection of high-quality, unstyled components for creating beautiful PDFs using React and TypeScript. Forget about docx, latex, or painful outdates libraries. With react-print, embrace a new way you create PDFs, designed by and for developers. 

# Why 

At [Onedoc](https://www.onedoclabs.com/), we believe documents are the core of communication. Invoice, contracts, resume, bill, etc. Documents are the #1 way to exchange information with others in a professional way, so why are we still using decades old technology to create them ? We believe that you deserve better. Document production needs to be modernized. Start today and create your next PDF the same way you build a webapp. And yes, it includes automation of data integration into your documents.

# Getting started 

## 1. Installation

Get the react-print component library.

### With npm 
```sh npm
npm install -s @onedoc/react-print
```
### With yarn
```sh yarn
yarn add @onedoc/react-print
```
### With pnpm
```sh pnpm
pnpm add @onedoc/react-print
```

## 2. Import component

Import the components you need to your PDF template from our list of pre-build components :

```javascript 
import { PageTop, PageBottom, PageBreak } from '@onedoc/react-print';
```

## 3. Integrate in your document:

Integrate your components and include styles where needed.

```javascript
export const document = ({props}) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <PageTop>
                <span>Hello #1</span>
            </PageTop>
            <div>
                Hello #2
            </div>
            <PageBottom>
                <div className="text-gray-400 text-sm">
                    Hello #3
                </div>
            </PageBottom>
            <PageBreak />
            <span>Hello #4, but on a new page ! </span>
        </div>
    );
};
```
